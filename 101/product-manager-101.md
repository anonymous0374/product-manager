# Basic concepts of a product manager

## Role
  There is not a role of a product manager at the very beginning, so itâ€™s often
misunderstood with other roles:
  1. program manager
  2. product marketing
  3. project management
  4. engineering management
  5. or sometimes in small companies, a founder or executive.

## Define the Role of a Product Manager with its Responsibilities

### Identifying and Assessing Opportunities from Numerous Sources such as:
  1. Customers
  2. Competitor's customers
  3. Industry analysis
  4. The sales and marketing staff
  5. The product development team
  6. Your company's customer service
  7. Your operations staff
  8. Your own experiences and domain knkowledge

### Define the Right Feature(from the above Opportunities) at Right Time
  Generally, the product manager identifies the product requirements and
captures them for the product team in the form of a Product Requirements
Document(PRD).

### Product Strategy and Roadmap
  Product means the collection of product releases. The releases are also the
responsibilites of the product manager. This is important not only for the
product management team, but also for other cross-functional teams.

### Represent Product Internally
  1. Evangelism of the product. Represent the product team across the company,
so as to get resources from the company(or the product may be cancelled).
  2. Review executives' points --> they may soud like giving specific strategy
when they only mean to suggest alternatives to be investigated and considered.
Good product manager should verify if it's valid or not.

### Represents Customer
  1. During a product being designed, developed, tested, and released, there're
hundereds of decisions to make. Good product manager should represent target
customers and ensure target customers are considered in these process.

### Product Manager do NOT manage people
  In most organizational structures, the product manager is not directly
"managing" any of the people who actually create the product:
  Engineers typically work for engineering managers, designers work for designer
managers, and the testers work for QA managers, and so on...
  Product manager does not have authority but maintains strong relationships
with the members of the team by mutual earned respect and his ability to
persuade with facts, logic, and profession.
