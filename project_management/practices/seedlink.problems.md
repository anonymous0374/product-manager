# problems

1. requirements are not properly handled, aka, not analysised(by a leader)
and not splited into small tasks, results in:
  (1) not able to estimate well --> cause delay
  (2) cannot trace the progress well --> cause project out of track
  (3) risks are likely to rise after the the development process started --> cause rework
2. modules may not be well defined, and developer has no ownership of modules,
results in:
  (1) no strong sense of responsibility
3. due to the manpower limitation, 1 engineer has to handle multiple modules,
or multi-tasking which results in:
  (1) not able to estimate well --> cause delay
  (2) difficult to trace --> cause project out of track
4. workflow is not well designed, results in:
  (1) idle time --> cause delay and low interactions(just waiting) among teams
  (2) back and forth of some steps --> cause rework
5. need to train testers or hire a senior tester to train the tester team
  (1) testers are not using up to date tools
  (2) testers do not have necessary higher-level knowledge

todo list:
1. work with product managers on requirements handling
2. define modules and clarify ownerships and responsibilities
3. understand the workloads of each engineer when doing estimation and hire more
engineers
4. observe and develop a suitable workflow, persuade the team to follow the
workflow
5. analysis the process of each iteration(sprint), and observe if there are any
other problems
